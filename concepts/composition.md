# Types of Composition 🎨

## Rule of Thirds 🟣🟢🔵
The Rule of Thirds involves dividing an image into thirds both vertically and horizontally, creating a grid. The points where the lines intersect are natural focal points and can be used to create balance and interest. 📏🖼️

## Symmetry 🦋
Symmetrical compositions involve creating a mirror image of a subject or dividing an image into two equal halves. This can create a sense of balance and order. 🦋👥

## Leading Lines 🚶
Leading lines draw the viewer's eye into an image and can be used to create a sense of depth or movement. These lines can be created by using diagonal or curved lines that guide the viewer's gaze. 🚶🔍

## Framing 🖼️
Framing involves using elements within an image to create a "frame" around the subject. This can create a sense of context and draw attention to the subject. 🖼️🔍

## Negative Space 🌌
Negative space refers to the empty space around a subject or within an image. Using negative space can create a sense of balance and give the subject room to breathe. 🌌🖼️

## Point of View 🤔
Point of view refers to the angle from which an image is taken. Changing the point of view can create a different perspective and evoke different emotions. 🤔📷
