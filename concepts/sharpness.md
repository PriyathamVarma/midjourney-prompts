# Sharpness 🔪
Sharpness refers to the clarity and detail in an image. A sharp image has a high level of detail and clarity, while a blurry image lacks detail and appears out of focus.

There are several factors that contribute to the sharpness of an image, including:

## Focus 🔍
Ensuring that the subject of the image is in sharp focus is key to creating a sharp image. This can be achieved by adjusting the focus manually or using autofocus.

## Aperture 📷
Using a smaller aperture can increase the depth of field, allowing more of the image to be in focus. This can help create a sharper image.

## Shutter Speed ⏰
Using a faster shutter speed can help freeze motion and create a sharper image. This is especially important when photographing moving subjects.

## Image Resolution 🖥️
Using a higher resolution image can help create a sharper image with more detail. This is especially important when printing or enlarging an image.
