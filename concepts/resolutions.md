# Types of Resolutions 🖥️

## Screen Resolution 📺
Screen resolution refers to the number of pixels on a screen, typically measured in width x height. For example, 1920x1080 is a common screen resolution for HD displays. 🖥️📏

## Print Resolution 🖨️
Print resolution refers to the number of dots per inch (DPI) or pixels per inch (PPI) in a printed image. Higher resolutions result in sharper and more detailed prints. 🖨️🖼️

## Optical Resolution 🔬
Optical resolution refers to the ability of an optical system to distinguish between two points. This is often measured in line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm) and determines how sharp and clear an image appears. 🔬👀

## Spatial Resolution 🗺️
Spatial resolution refers to the ability of a sensor or imaging system to distinguish between objects or features that are close together. This is often measured in meters per pixel and determines the level of detail captured in satellite or aerial images. 🛰️🗺️

## Time Resolution ⏱️
Time resolution refers to the ability of a system to measure or capture changes over time. This is often measured in frames per second (fps) for video or samples per second for audio. 🎥⏱️

By understanding the different types of resolutions, you can ensure that your images, videos, and other media are captured or displayed at the appropriate quality and level of detail for your needs.
