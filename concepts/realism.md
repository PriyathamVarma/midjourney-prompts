# Types of Realism in Images 📷
## Photorealism 📸
This style aims to create an image that looks as realistic as a photograph. 📷👀

## Hyperrealism 🌟
Similar to photorealism, hyperrealism takes realism to the extreme, creating images that are so lifelike they can be mistaken for photographs. 🤯📸

## Surrealism 🧐
While surrealism isn't necessarily focused on realism, it does often involve realistic elements that are combined in unusual or dreamlike ways. Surrealistic images can be unsettling or thought-provoking. 🤔🎨

## Impressionism 🎨
Impressionistic images aim to capture the essence of a scene or subject, rather than portraying it in a strictly realistic way. This style often features loose brushwork and bold colors, and is characterized by a sense of movement and spontaneity. 🎨🖌️

## Expressionism 😮
Like impressionism, expressionism is more concerned with conveying a mood or emotion than achieving realism. Expressionistic images can be abstract or figurative, and often feature exaggerated or distorted forms, bold colors, and energetic brushwork. 😲🎨
